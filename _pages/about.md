I hold a Bachelor's degree in Engineering in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science.
Proficient in C/C++, Java, Python, SQL, JavaScript, and Ruby, I have hands-on experience in developing efficient and scalable software solutions.
I am currently delving into advanced topics in Machine Learning and Cybersecurity, driven by a desire to contribute to innovative solutions in these fields.
Deeply passionate about learning, I am fascinated by topics such as Deep Learning, Algorithms, Cryptography, and the broader connections between technology, reasoning, and engineering.
Beyond technology, I find inspiration in cinema, music, and science, which fuel my curiosity and creativity.
I am a lifelong learner who thrives on uncovering new knowledge and embracing challenges, always eager to grow both personally and professionally in dynamic environments.
